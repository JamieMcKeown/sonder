I chose to do this assessment using PHP (Laravel) as it is the language I am most used to. I opted for server-side rendering using a MVC pattern.

Important notes:
 1- I struggled bigtime with docker as I am not used to the workflow. My experience was really limited to just docker-compose up in my previous jobs as it was all set up by our dev-ops. I do however find it really cool and see the benefit of being able to solve the "well it works on my machine" concern.
 
 2- the past 18 months I have been using phpstorm and always a GUI for my version control so there was a significant adjustment for me to make. (excuses, excuses.. lol)

I wanted to initially complete this assignment using Vuejs as a front end and have the backend set up as an API however I was unable to add the Vuejs image correctly and decided it is best if I remove that layer of abstraction.

At the end of the day, this assessment was excellent in terms of forcing me to learn docker in more detail ( about 8 hours of tutorials watched on youtube) and has opened my eyes to certain areas I can improve on.

Going forward I am going to improve my skills in docker and improve on command line git/github or finding a good GUI to manage. In addition, I am going to work on a personal project using FLASK as my backend and ease my way into python web development.
